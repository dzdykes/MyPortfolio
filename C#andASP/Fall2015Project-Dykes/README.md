#Instrument Rental Website
----
###Objective
Create a data driven website using ASP.NET framework, C#, and HTML/CSS. This should be a website created entirely from my own design. It should contain login capabilities and be able to set cookies on the user's machine. Also, this site should use ASP.NET controls such as DetailsView and GridView. The database used in the site should be obtained through Microsoft Access. Overall the objective of this project is to put to use what I have learned about C# and ASP.NET over a semester.

###Tools
Visual Studio was the IDE that was used and Microsoft Access was the database management system used.

###Procedure
First come up with the database structure and entity relationships. Next design the basic layout of the website using HTML/CSS and ASP.NET controls. Next, implement a login screen and set cookies. Lastly, create administrative pages so that the database can be updated. 

###Result
The website compiles fine and the user can log-in or sign-up, choose an instrument to rent, and a confirmation page shows the summary of the user's order. Also, an administrator can update, create, and delete any data from any table in the database.
