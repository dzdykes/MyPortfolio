#Rock Paper Scissors
----
###Objective
Develop a GUI that is a two play rock paper scissors game. The GUI should allow both palyers to simultaneously choose rock paper or scissors. The program should also keep track of the score and display the player's choice as a picture.

###Tools
Java 7 as the programming language and Eclispe as the IDE.

###Procedure
Write the code that will decide who one each based on the user's choice. Come up with a user interface and method so that each player can my their choice at the same time. Create a method for keeping score.

###Result
The program works and look pretty good. Each player has three designated keys on the keyboard that correspond to rock, paper or 
scissors. Scoring is accurate and the pictures reflect the user's choice.
