#Check Writer GUI
######[Link to Project](https://github.com/dzdykes/BillDylanProject)
----
###Objective
Work in a two person team to write GUI application that will be able to look up information about employees stored in a database. 
The user should be able to edit employee information. Also, the user will be able to enter the hours the employee worked in a pay 
period and create a sample check for that employee based on their hourly wage and hours worked. This application should have an 
easy to use and easy to understand graphical interface. 

###Tools
Java 7 as the programming language, Eclispe as the IDE, Java Scenebuilder for the GUI, Apache Derby as the DBMS, and Github as the content management system. 

###Procedure
Create a database and populate it with dummy data. Write a java file that will access information from the databases using defined
methods. Create a GUI that will display the employees in a listbox and a chosen employee's infomation in multiple textboxs. Create
another tab in the GUI that will show the sample check that should be written for that employee based on their hours worked and pay rate. Make modifications to my [CheckWriter Code](https://github.com/dzdykes/Chapter8Lab/blob/master/src/main/java/edu/carrollcc/cis232/Question2.java) so it can be used with this project. 

###Result
The program works and can write sample checks for both salary employees and hourly employees. One of the hardest parts of this project was getting the GUI to access information within the database. Working as team was a different experience for me as I have done most of my projects alone. It was a good experience and nice to be able to bounce ideas off of someone.
