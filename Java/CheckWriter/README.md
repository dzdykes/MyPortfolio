###Objective
Write a console application using Java that will accept a numerical input by the user and return a string output that expresses the
value of the numerical input. The numerical input will be a double representing an amount a check will be written for. 

###Tools
Java 7 as the programming language and Eclispe as the IDE.

###Procedure
Hard code the words for numbers 1-19. Next use a string of if-else statements to get the word representation of 20 - 99. Next use
math and some if-else statement to decide where words like hundred and thousand should go. Lastly, concatenate the decimal part of
the number.

###Result
The program runs well but could be more efficient. The program handles numbers up to 999,999,999.
