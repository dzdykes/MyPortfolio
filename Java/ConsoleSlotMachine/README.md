#Console Slot Machine
----
###Objective
Create a console application that is will show off the skills I learned in my first Java programming class. The project I chose was to create a slot machine. This slot machine should look good (for a console application), have realistic payouts, and simulate the slot playing experience.  

###Tools
Java 7 as the programming language and Netbeans as the IDE

###Procedure
Create the logic for simulating wheels on a slot machine. Make sure that the each wheel is indedent of the next. Create the payout logic for when three alike symbols are hit. Create a simply understood user interface in the console. Create a dynamic user experience by adding time delays and console graphics.

###Result
The program works great. It is a good simulation of real slot machine payouts. I created a test class that allowed me to run the program over ten-thousand times. This showed that the person playing was neither bankrupt nor did they aquire a fortune, but they were hover right around the where they started. I also, added some easter eggs, for instance if you enter your name as "Jackpot" in the beginning it will cause Jackpots to hit much more frequently. This was a fun and educational project that was one of my first applications I created using Java.
