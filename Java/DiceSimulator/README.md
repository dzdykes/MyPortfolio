###Objective
Write a GUI that will simulate the roll a two dice. The GUI should have images for the dice, a button to roll the dice and display the total of the two the dice.

###Tools
Java 7 as the programming language, JavaFX SceneBuilder 2.0, and Eclispe as the IDE

###Procedure
Write the code that will choose two random numbers between 1 and 6, and choose an image file to load based on the random number. Total the two numbers and display in a label. Add some style to the program background color and such.

###Result
Runs great and is effcient with memory. At first every roll would increase the memory used. By loading all the six images of the die faces at once in an image array I was able keep the memory usage low and consistent rather than it rising every time the dice were rolled. Also, I added a feature the will randomly rotate each die for every spin. This creates the illusion the dice landing in a random position with each through
