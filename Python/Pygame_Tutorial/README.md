#Pygame Tutorial
----
###Objective
Learn how to use the Pygame module by following along with a tutorial. Also, implement some of my
own features that show I know how to use this module.

###Tools
Python 3.4 and IDLE were used to develop the project. Pygame was the module used to create the 
GUI.

###Procedure
Build the basics of the game such as exiting the game, moving the car back and forth, and generating the
blocks that will be attacking the car. Add event handlers to run a crash method when the car and blocks 
came into contact. Create a pause screen. Add a scoring element to the game. Add sounds, theme music and 
sfx. Add features and design of my own creation such as simulating the cars movement, adding up and down 
abilities for the car, and add a fun background. 

###Conclusion
The game runs great and looks great too. The scoring works and the game's difficulty increases with each 
block dodged. I was able to learn the basics of Pygame and develop a fun application.
