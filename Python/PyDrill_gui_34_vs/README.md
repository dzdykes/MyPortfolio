#Webpage Creator
----
###Objective
Create a GUI that will allow a user to create or edit simple HTML files. The GUI should allow the user to create and/or edit the 
body text of an html file.

###Tools
Visual Studio and Python 3.4 were used to develop the project. tkinter was used as the module for creating the GUI. 

###Procedure
Create a class that could right from a string input in Python to an HTML file. Implement this class in a GUI that will get the 
file name and body text from user input. 

###Conclusion
Works like a charm, the user can create a simple HTML file using the GUI and whatever body text they chose. I added an edit feature 
that allows the user to edit an existing html file that has been written by this GUI before. Also, after creating the page the 
default web browser for that platform will load the page.
