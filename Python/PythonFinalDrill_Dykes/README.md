#Python Final Drill
----
###Objective
Take an hour or so to create a python project of my own design. While using tkinter I noticed that there is 
no way to easily create table. I decided to create a function that would easily create a table from a specified 
table in a database. 

###Tool
Visual Studio 2013, Python 3.4 and tkinter were used to develop this project. 

###Procedure
To attack this program I decided to first create a table using tkinter's grid view and an arbitrary table from a 
database. I then decided what hard-coded variables should be parameters of the function and scaled the function up 
to work for a cable of any size.

###Conclusion
The program functions and the table is well formatted and displays information from a table in an organized manner. 
The table and all its elements are children to a parent frame that should have no other children. I would like to 
make this function callable outside the program in the future.
