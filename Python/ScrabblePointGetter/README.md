#ScrabblePointGetter
----
###Objective
Create a GUI that will allow a user to enter in a word and its modifiers and will return a point value based on the Hasbro game
Scrabble's scoring system.

###Tools
Python 2.7 and IDLE were used to create the project. wxPython was used to create the GUI and the scoring is based off of the 
Hasbro game scrabble.

###Procedure
Create a dictionary with the each letter and corresponding point value. Figure out the to handle special squares such as "Double
Letter" and "Triple Word". Calaculate point value based on a string input from a user. Display a score breakdown and score. Build
a GUI for a nicer display.

###Conclusion
The program works and can calculate the score of any string input from a user. The GUI is organized and understandable. In the 
future I'd like to have a flashier GUI and tie it to a database containing valid words or a dictionary so that the user can't enter
nonsense to be scored.
