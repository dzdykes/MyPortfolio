#Data Transfer GUI
----
###Objective
Create a GUI that transfer files from one folder to another. The user should be able to chose both
folders. Alsok, the files should only be transfered if they were modified within the past 24 Hours.
The program should also store information about each time files are transfered in a database. The 
database will store the timestamp at the time of transfer and the directories that were involved.

###Tools
Python 2.7 and IDLE were used to develop the project. wxPython was the module used to create the 
GUI. Sqlite is used as the DBMS.
