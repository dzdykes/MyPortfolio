#Data Transfer GUI
----
###Objective
Create a GUI that transfer files from one folder to another. The user should be able to chose both
folders. Alsok, the files should only be transfered if they were modified within the past 24 Hours.
The program should also store information about each time files are transfered in a database. The 
database will store the timestamp at the time of transfer and the directories that were involved.

###Tools
Python 2.7 and IDLE were used to develop the project. wxPython was the module used to create the 
GUI. Sqlite is used as the DBMS. 

###Procedure
Create a program that will transfer files from one folder to another. Create a program that will
find out what files from a given directory have been modified in the past 24 hours. Design the 
database and a module to interact with it. Create a GUI that allows the user to choose the directories
that involved in the transfer. Put everything together.

###Conclusion
The program works great the GUI looks professional, organized, and understandable. I added a feature
that allows the user to choose whether or not to delete the orginal copies of the files. This was 
useful in testing and debugging because it prevented creating lots of copies of the same file.
